# Hazards

## Acute Respiratory Hazards
The materials and chemical reactions that make molds and dice possible to make at home also come with some exposure risks during the mixing and pouring process.

## Contact Hazards
The chemicals in uncured resin and silicones aren't great for your skin and can cause short and long term reactions.

## Long Term Exposure
The more you are exposed to something, the more chances you have to develop a reaction to that material. 

## Mishaps
Not every attempt will go perfectly, have a contingency plan so that you know what to do if things don't work out!

# Prepare
Tips for being safe from the start.

## Safety Data Sheets
Read your safety data sheets! Every type of resin and silicone is slightly different. The products you buy should come with safety information like a Safety Data Sheet (SDS or MSDS). This document will outline the precautions to take when using the material and what to do if you do come into direct contactwith it. 

## PPE (Personal Protection Equipment)
Get your safety equipment before you start!
- Think of safety equipment as a requirement for getting started rather than an optional add on.
- Factor the costs of ongoing safety materials into your starting costs and pricing equations. 
- Know how to clean up spills before they happen!

### Respirators
A respirator with filters rated for organic vapors will protect your lungs from the fumes put off by mixing and curing resin. A half face respirator is the minimum, if you are sensitive to the fumes consider a full face respirator. Check the directions for your respirator filters to determine how often they should be replaced. If dry sanding, consider a particulate filtering mask. 

### Contact PPE
Use nitrile gloves to keep your hands safe from chemicals. Some nitrile gloves can cause cure inhibition, this can be avoided by using vinyl gloves when pouring silicone.

Consider double-gloving if you deal with gloves breaking.

Silicone and resin are hydrophobic, you will not be able to rinse them off if they get on your skin. If you rest your arms on your work surface, consider wearing a long sleeve shirt or other arm barrier. Anyone can develop a sensitivity with repeated skin exposure. 

### Eye and Ear Protection
Most of the chemicals used in dice making are liquids. Things can splash, bubble, and otherwise go where they are not expected to.

Wear protective eye wear so that if your resin mixing produces a stray bubble it doesn't end up in your eye!

Many compressors are very loud! If you are going to be around one while it is running, wear ear/hearing protection.
