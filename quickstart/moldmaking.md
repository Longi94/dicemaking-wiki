# Mold Types

## Slab Molds
These molds have many dice that are cast at the same time within a single larger mold. These molds are easy to move as a unit and are typically cap molds.

## Cap Molds
These molds have a base with a separate cap with a single face of the die on it. Sometimes called squish molds (although the name is more commonly used for cap-sprue hybrids or the "Wish Style" molds)

## Sprue Molds
These molds are a single unit with a hole at the top to inject resin in. These molds typically have cuts down the sides so that the dice can be removed and usually need to be taped in order to keep the resin from leaking while casting.

## Wish Molds

Wish or Amazon mold sets under $20. These molds are some of the most common types that come up when searching for dice molds. Although they are very affordable, they are very difficult to get viable dice out of. Know that you are going to have difficulties if you start with this type of mold.

# Silicone

## Platinum Cure
- Platinum Cure silicones are the most popular choice among the makers in our community. 
- There are may different types of platinum cure silicones, but Mold Star 20T is the current favorite
- Platinum Cure silicones are very sensitive to items that have been freshly 3D printed. Please check with your master printer to see how to use them with platinum cure silicone. 
- Sometimes called "Addition Cure" Silicone

## Tin Cure
- Tin Cure silicones are not as prone to cure inhibition, so they can be used to mold 3D printed items more quickly than platinum.
- These silicones don't retain quite as much detail as platinum cure. Most of the time Tin Cure is used to get a resin cast of the masters before polishing and re-molding in platinum cure. 
- This silicone is also very sensitive to humidity and fragile. This is not a recommended silicone outside of specific circumstances. 
- Sometimes called "Condensation Cure"

# Mold Making Process

## Cap Mold

### 1. Prepare your masters
Ensure your dice masters are polished, clean, and dry.
> A warm soapy bath can help here!
{.is-info}

### 2. Mold Body
Secure the dice to your mold base within the mold body. Place them about 1/4" away from each other. Ensure the edges are liquid tight (Hot glue if needed).

### 3. Pour your Mold body
Following the directions of your silicone, mix and pour it inside the mold body. Pressurize 5-10 PSI above what you cast dice at for the full cure time.

### 4. Prepare for the Cap
Remove the mold base from the mold body, apply mold release or Vaseline to the surface of the mold (but not the dice!). Cut in keys if your mold body does not create them. Tape or otherwise prepare the cap edges to be liquid tight.

### 5. Pour your cap
Following the directions of your silicone, mix and pour it inside the cap body. Pressurize 5-10 PSI above what you cast dice at for the full cure time.

### 6. Clean up
Remove your mold from the pressure pot. Gently cut any areas where the silicone adhered to itself.

Clean off the surfaces with a little bit of IPA.

### 7. Remove your dice
Gently remove your master dice from the mold. 

Check inside each mold for any cure inhibition or torn numbers. 

### 8. Optional
If making a sprue-cap hybrid mold, you can add in any sprue holes after the mold is finished.

### 2. Mold Body
Secure the dice to your sprue (Position the sprue to not touch any numbers). and then to the base within the mold body. Ensure the edges of the mold body are liquid tight (Hot glue if needed). 

### 3. Pour your Mold
Following the directions of your silicone, mix and pour it inside the mold body. Pressurize 5-10 PSI above what you cast dice at for the full cure time.

### 4. Cut out the Die
Remove the mold base from the mold body.

Carefully cut down to the die and remove it from the mold. Avoid touching your masters with the craft knife. 

## Typical Issues

### Cure Inhibition
If you experience sticky or improperly cured silicone, you will need to carefully remove your masters from the mold. Clean them well with warm soapy water and a soft toothbrush. Make sure the numbers are free of any leftover silicone. 

Check our Troubleshooting guide for potential causes and tips before attempting to make the mold again.

### Silicone to Silicone Adhesion
If the area is small, you can use a craft knife to carefully cut the two parts loose. 

If the full cap is adhered, you will need to gently cut your masters out of the mold and start anew. Make sure to use plenty of mold release or Vaseline next time.

### Raised Faces
If you are experiencing raised faces with your newly made mold, make sure your keys are being properly lined up when placing the cap. 

Use a gentle but firm pressure to ensure the cap is fully seated onto the mold. There should be almost no gap between the two pieces. 

Consider using a small weight to hold down the cap. The weight should be enough to apply gentle even pressure downward but not too heavy as to warp the mold as it cures.

# Mold Keys

**Mold Keys are special indentations in the mold body and cap that allow you to line up the lid and base. Good keys will also help prevent raised faces.**

Every maker has their own preferred mold and key style. Some mold systems will have built-in keys or you can cut your own.

Recessed keys are created with things like cabochons or are cut into the mold before casting the cap. 

Raised keys are created by indentations in the base of the mold body. 

Both types of keys will need a liberal application of mold release or Vaseline to keep them intact through the creation of the cap.

# Mold Release
**Silicone poured on top of cured silicone without some sort of barrier will adhere to itself.**

The main options for creating this barrier are Mold Release and Vaseline. 

To apply Mold Release, spray liberally (use PPE) across the cured surface of the mold body. Use a Q-tip with some IPA to wipe off the face of the dice. If you don't remove the mold release from the surface of the die you will have matte cap faces. 

To apply Vaseline use a liberal amount on a Q-tip or a small paint brush to coat all of the silicone surface and keys. Be careful to avoid the actual faces of the dice.
