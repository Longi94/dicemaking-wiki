# Safety First

### Take Some Basic Safety Precautions

Pour in a well ventilated space and protect your lungs. Don't get resin or silicone on your skin or in your eyes ([See the PPE Guide!](/en/quickstart/ppe))

### Check the Safety Data Sheets for your Materials

Every material is different - Check the specific details for each material you are working with.

### Ask for Help

If you have a strange situation or are working with a unique material you can always ask if someone else has encountered the same issue!

# Design

**What dice will you be making?**

Dice designs are incredibly personal to the maker. Ensure that you are using IP-safe materials. 

Consider purchasing a pre-made mold from a known maker or using your own masters. You can also purchase generic or custom masters if you can't 3d print.

If you would like to make your own molds, please see the mold making guide. 

You can sell dice made from your own masters or made from some purchased molds. Please read all listings carefully to know what is and isn't allowed with what you are purchasing (this includes fonts!). 

If you plan on molding existing dice that you do not own the rights to reproduce, please know that this server takes IP theft from other artists very seriously. Many factory dice companies display warnings about molding their dice and some are known to pursue legal action.

# Mixing Resin Tips

### Know how to portion your resin

Your resin will specify the ratio needed of resin to hardener, as well as if that ratio is based on weight or volume. Most resins used by makers here are by volume. Use cups with built in volume markers or cups of the same size to easily portion both parts.

### Properly mixing the resin

Once you have combined both parts into a single cup for mixing, make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the container as well as your stirring stick to ensure all the resin is mixed. 

Be mindful not to mix too much resin together in the same cup as it the thermal reaction can cause the cup to become very hot and begin to flash cure. This is typically not a problem for the amounts of resin used to cast a set of dice or two at a time.

### Adding Mix-ins or Colorants

Certain water based colorants should only be used in very small amounts as water does not react well with resin.

Too much colorant or mica powder can cause soft curing in dice.

## Coloring & Designing Dice

### There are many different products that can be used to color and design dice.

Resin dyes, Alcohol Inks, Pigments, glitters, mica powers, foil leaf, mylar, etc. 

### What brands should I use?

There are many different brands used by makers here. Piñata Blanco Blanco is the best white ink. Other popular brands include Ranger, Bree Reese, Piñata, and Picasso. 

### Can I use any at-home items?

Yes, some things you already have like eyeshadow, chalk pastels, or dry water color paint can be used to color resin. You may want to test these to see how they turn out in cured resin.

# Pouring & Designing

### 1. Prepare Safely

- Read the safety information for your materials.
- Prepare your area for pouring.
- Don your PPE.

### 2. Pour your resin

- Portion your resin according to the package instructions.
- Mix until the resin is clear and streak-free.

### 3. Design your dice

- Split your resin as needed, mix in any colorants or inclusions.
- Pour the resin into the molds.

### 4. Check Fill Level

- Ensure your molds are full to overfilled.
- (Cap your molds if using cap molds.)
- (Ensure the reservoir is full if using sprue molds.)

### 5. Pressurize

- Place your molds into the pressure pot before the end of the pot life.
- Keep molds pressurized until the demold time for your resin.

### 6. Demold

- Gently remove the dice from your mold.
- Remove any flashing gently or with flush cutters.

### 7. Let it Rest

- Let your dice rest until the full or "hard cure" time for your resin has elapsed.
- Protect these dice from dust or bumping into sharp objects (like other dice).

### 8. Polish your dice

- Use sand or polishing papers to do any needed shaping.
- Go up through the levels until your dice are shiny. Consider using a polishing compound.

> Wet sanding is best!

### 9. Ink Your Dice

- Give your dice a warm soapy bath to clean off any dust.
- Use a small paint brush and quality paint to ink your dice.

### 10. Cleanup Your Dice

- Use a q-tip with some IPA or a small IPA wipe to clean off any excess paint.

### 11. Enjoy your shindy dice!

## Road Map

This guide can help you determine what stage your resin needs to be at for the technique you are using.

# Common Issues

## Uncured Resin

If your resin never fully cures inside your molds (typically caused by improper mixing or temperature issues), it will need to be carefully removed. Use proper PPE and carefully scoop out the uncured resin. Use some warm soapy water and a soft toothbrush to clean out the rest of the residue inside the molds. You can use a little bit of IPA to wipe out any remaining residue as well.

## Cure Inhibition

If you experience sticky or improperly cured silicone, you will need to carefully remove your masters from the mold. Clean them well with warm soapy water and a soft toothbrush. Make sure the numbers are free of any leftover silicone. Check our Troubleshooting guide for potential causes and tips before attempting to make the mold again.

## Soft Cure Resin

Please see the Troubleshooting slide on soft cure dice. You may be able to save them.

# Photographing Dice

## Lighting

Daylight or Diffused Lighting will bring out the best in your dice! 

If you can't use daylight, a light box can help. You can also use parchment or baking paper to diffuse an existing light. 

## Set Up

Using a clean backdrop and simple props (like plants!) can help make your image stand out.

Using a light box can help create a clean backdrop for your images.

## Images

Don't be afraid to take many images and narrow them down as you go.

Crop in your images to focus on your dice.

Consider getting a macro lens to highlight the smaller details in your dice (there are some that can attach to most phones).

Try to avoid using color filters on your dice, they're pretty the way they are! If you have to color correct because they aren't photographing true to color, make sure to mention why it's being used so people don't feel misled.

# Casting Without a Pressure Pot

1. Put both part A and B into a warm water bath for 15 minutes prior to mixing them together (this helps the bubbles rise to the surface and pop).

2. pour your two parts together and mix. To reduce bubbles use a silicone stir rather than wood sticks as wood is porous and adds to the bubbles. 

3. once done stirring let sit for 2-3 minutes and then spray one spritz of rubbing alcohol to pop any surface bubbles that haven’t quite popped yet. 

4. RIGHT before you pour the resin into the mold spray a spritz of rubbing alcohol into the mold and pour the resin in! 

5. wait another 5ish mins and spray one last spritz to pop surface bubbles and put the lid on! 

> While this will significantly reduce the amount of bubbles without a pressure pot it will be near impossible to get rid of all the bubbles! But it’s a good work around if you don’t have one.
