# Safety First

### Take Some Basic Safety Precautions

Pour in a well ventilated space and protect your lungs. Don't get resin or silicone on your skin or in your eyes ([See the PPE Guide!](/en/quickstart/ppe))

### Check the Safety Data Sheets for your Materials

Every material is different - Check the specific details for each material you are working with.

### Ask for Help

If you have a strange situation or are working with a unique material you can always ask if someone else has encountered the same issue!
