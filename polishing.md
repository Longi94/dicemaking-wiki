# Protecting your Masters

If you are not 3D printing your own masters, you may want to consider the below method in order to reduce the need for ordering re-prints. 

Some rough masters are harder to shape than others, this method also allows you more opportunities to get the shaping right. 

1. When you receive the 3d prints of your masters, follow your seller's instructions for cleaning and molding. Set aside your printed masters in a safe place.
2. Cast a set of resin masters from your first mold. These will be your rough masters. 
3. Sand your resin masters to the desired finish. If anything goes wrong at this stage, you can re-cast in the rough master mold to make another set to try again. 
4. Create a Mold from your resin masters, store them in a safe place to use for making future molds.

# Polishing Masters

Start with sandpaper that is 400-600 grit. Sandpaper helps remove supports and print lines from masters or sprue marks. Wet the paper before starting to polish. Remember to periodically rinse paper and dice in water to clean off the build up of resin dust. This will help the sheet last longer and not get clogged with resin. 

When holding the dice you want a light grip and even pressure. Dice should glide over the paper. Applying too much pressure will cause the dice to snag and will send the dice flying. The harder you press down the more resin will be removed. Check the face often by drying off the water with a rag or paper towel. Randomize your pattern about 10 circles clockwise and 10 counterclockwise. Your technique can vary. Polishing takes time to master. The more you polish you will refine your technique. What works for one person might not work for the next. Experiment and find what works best for you.

The easiest way to keep track of which faces on the d20 you have sand/polished is to start at 1 and rotate until you hit 1 again. Flip dice find 20 rotate until you hit 20; do the one under the 20 and work your way around the die.

### Polishing Tips & Tricks

As part of the ongoing lesson initiative, we anticipate having a few lessons on polishing and sanding techniques. Please consider joining one of the classes live or watching the recordings if they have already happened.

#### Dremel Polishing

Some makers use a Dremel with a cotton polishing head and polishing compound to polish their dice after any flashing is removed and some sandpaper/Zona cleanup. 

#### Tumbler Polishing

Some makers use a vibratory tumbler (filled with polishing medium and polishing compound) to polish their dice over time.

### Cleaning Resin Dust From Numbers

Use a soft toothbrush or pick with water or a mixture of soap and water. Alternately, you can use an ultrasonic cleaner.

# Inking

### What can I use?

You can use things like Acrylics, Mini Paints, Alcohol inks, Paint pens, etc. You want something that has a small enough tip to get into the numbers or that you can use a small brush to apply.

### How do I clean up?

After you've gotten the inking into your numbers and smoothed out, you will likely have some excess on the faces of your dice. To clean this up you can use IPA or makeup wipes. Alternatively, you can ink before moving to the 2nd to last zona and then polish off the excess ink.

# Pottery Wheel Polishing

A mini pottery wheel can help to speed up the sanding/polishing process. You add a small round mirror to the top of the wheel. Wet zona will stick to the mirror and you can polish away.

## Technique

When polishing your dice on a wheel you want to go against the rotation of the wheel. Rotate the dice like you are trying to find a station on an old radio or TV. This keeps you from getting a uniformed polish that will show micro scratches. More random the pattern the better the polish will be.

# Tumbler Polishing

From @Druid_Dice

Tumble gang rise up! (hit flashing edge with 30um/15um then tumble for 36hrs for full glass shine.

[Tumbler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYGLJC) (HF one is trash - leave off the lid/don't put threaded bar in the top as it will scratch. some folks use a funnel upside down to stop this).

[3M compound seed media](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LIXEL3U) with 8-10oz, refresh with 1oz when you drop in new sets)

[Media](https://www.kramerindustriesonline.com/product/hardwood-tumbling-media/) (You want the small NC-1 cubes, at least 5lb as the tumbler uses about 3lb)
