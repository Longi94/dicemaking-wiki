I pressurize it, wait 30 min, depressurize and flip, repressurize and wait 30 min, depressurize and flip. I do that every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours

Because it keeps inclusions from sinking

Seems to work okay for me lmao

It's easier for the bubbles to be compressed when the resin is at its softest and the longer that the resin sits, the longer it takes for the bubbles to reinflate. Depressurizing, flipping, and repressurizing within a couple of minutes tends to keep the bubbles from re-expanding. if you were just to leave them out of the pressure pot and flip every 30 minutes for the first two hours, then put them in the pot after that time, it would be more difficult for the bubbles to compress under pressure.
