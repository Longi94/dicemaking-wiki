# B

## Blanks
Slightly smaller dice that don't have numbers. They can later be put into normal dice molds as an inclusion to cast a shell around them.

# C

## Compressor
The device that creates pressure inside a pressure pot.

## Cure
This is the term for when the resin dries/hardens/solidifies over time. There are a few stages of curing called Soft cure and Hard cure. The time needed to reach these stages is different for each resin brand.

- **Soft Cure**: This is when the resin has hardened enough to appear solid, but still has a softer consistency. They can seem finished, but the resin can bend, stretch, and warp if handled too harshly. Epoxy resin reaches this stage in 12-24 hours. What can you do in the Soft Cure stage? Pull them from the mold and carefully clip the sprue. 
> What can you NOT do in the Soft Cure stage? Sanding/polishing in this stage will only cloud up the faces and ruin the dice.

- **Hard Cure**: After the resin is fully cured and rock solid; this is the point where you can sand/polish. Different brands have different cure times, but waiting a few days before polishing only ensures that you waited long enough.

# D

## Dirty pour
A technique where the different colors are put together but don't actually mix. As they are poured, they sort of expand like an infinite fractal.

# E

## Epoxy Resin
A long-cure plastic that can be used to make dice. It has two chemicals that are mixed together; then it starts a solidifying process known as Curing. This type can take 24 hours before you can handle it, and longer before you can work with it.

# F

## Flashing
The paper-thin resin that resulted from liquid resin getting between parts of the mold that should be pressed together.

# H

## Hardener
This is one of the two chemicals mixed in Epoxy resin. The name is misleading as both chemicals need to be mixed at a proper ratio for the resin to cure (solidify) properly; having even slightly more or less of either chemical will result in the resin not hardening properly.

## Hot Water Bath
A process used to reduce potential bubbles when a pressure pot is not used. Both the resin and hardener bottles are placed into a ziplock bag, which is then placed in a vessel with hot water for about 10-15min. This thins the resin, making it easier for bubbles to escape after mixing and pouring, although it shortens the pot time of the resin.
> Be careful not to introduce any water from the bath into the resin, as this can cause curing issues.

# M

## Masters
The template used to create a mold with.

## Metal leaf (gold/silver/copper/ext)
Actual metal foil that is so thin and light, it can suspend inside
of resin and not affect balance.

## Mica Powder
A concentrated pigment used to colour resin, etc, which usually produces a more opaque result. 

## Meeple
A little token in the shape of a person used in tabletop gaming to represent the player. Often, resin crafters would pour their leftover resin into meeple molds.

## Mold

A negative made out of silicone which is used to cast dice. See: sprue mold, sandwich/squish/cap mold .

### Cap/Squish mold
A mold where one face of the die is on a lid section of silicone. 

### Sprue mold
A mold where the resin is poured through a small channel. After the resin cures, the dice will have a stem from the resin that was in the channel. This stem is called a Sprue, and needs to be cut off; the area that the sprue attaches to needs to be shaped properly so that it looks like it was never there.

## Mold Release
A chemical agent that helps silicone detach from resin.

# O

## Oomoo
A tin cure silicone that is NOT RECOMENDED for molds (very problematic).

# P

## Pigment
Coloration chemicals.

## Petri
A pouring technique that creates wispy/organic tendrils.

## Pot Time
After mixing resin parts, the Pot Time refers to how long it has before it solidifies
too much to work with. 

## PPE
Personal Protective Equipment. For dice, you should have a respirator, gloves, and eye
wear.

## Pressure Pot
A vessel designed to hold pressure from a compressor. It is used to reduce the size of air bubbles in resin or silicone until they are virtually invisible. This is the ideal device for working with resin as it will cure under pressure.

# R

## Respirator
A mask to filter the toxic fumes of resin.

# S

## Silicone
A chemical that solidifies into a rubber that resin generally does not stick to. This is the chemical used to make molds.

- Tin cure silicone
- Platinum cure silicone

# U

# UV Resin
A fast-cure plastic that can be used to make dice or fill voids. This type is a single chemical that solidifies when exposed to UV light. This type can harden very quickly.

# V

## Vacuum Chamber
A vessel used with a vacuum pump to pull air bubbles out of resin or silicone. While this can degass silicone and resin before using them, working with the chemicals will introduce more air into them. You would not use this when curing as it will suck the resin out of the mold. 

## Viscosity
The thickness of a liquid.

# Z

## Zona
A brand of polishing sheets that are widely accepted as the best option for polishing dice.
