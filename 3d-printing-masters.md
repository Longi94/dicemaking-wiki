# Design
[Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) - Free for "hobbyist" use, more math based, simpler numbering, can use parameters to resize easily 

Tutorial: [Kristian_Laholm](https://www.youtube.com/c/KristianLaholm/videos) has all the polyhedral shapes

# Slicing

Generating supports: [Chitubox](https://www.chitubox.com/) - Basic support generation, comes with most printers by default, bit buggy.

[PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) -This is better for non dice prints, can automatically orient, and has better auto support generation

[RevChumley Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXX-zpRYDS0) - This is the suggested method of supporting your dice, with additional manual supports for problem areas.

### Can I use an FDM Printer to make dice masters? 

While technically possible, it is much harder to make viable dice masters that can be polished via FDM printing. The level of cleanup needed is much greater than with SLA Printers.
