# Raised Faces

### What it Looks Like

A section of the cap face that is significantly higher than it should be, sanding it flat would remove the number.

### Causes

- Improperly seated caps
- Caps that are too light

### Fixes

- Make sure caps are firmly seated and any keys are fully aligned 
- Evenly weigh Down the caps with something that isn't too heavy
- Tape Down Caps with painters tape

# Voids

### What it Looks Like

Holes in dice, typically near the cap face or corners.

### Causes

- Underfilling Molds
- Not putting some extra resin on the cap face

### Fixes

- Add some extra resin to the cap face
- Fill the void with UV Resin and cure it with a UV flashlight or UV Nail Light.
- If resin is "frothy" allow it to sit to ensure the mold is still fully filled after bubbles pop
- Consider a sprue-cap hybrid mold

# Cure Inhibition

### What it Looks Like

Sticky or uncured Silicone

### Causes

- 3d printed masters that aren't fully cured
- Improperly mixed silicone
- Old Silicone
- Latex and some nitrile gloves

### Fixes

- Pre-test a small amount of silicone on a single face of the die before fully casting
- Give your masters some more resting time before casting
- Fully clean any uncured silicone from your masters before re-attempting

> Do not use uncured silicone as filler in a new mold - it will poison it!

# Surface Bubbles

### What it Looks Like

Many small bubbles, typically grouped around the cap face

### Causes

- No Pressure Pot
- "Frothing" the resin when mixing
- Cold Resin

### Fixes

- Warming the resin bottles in hot water (Careful! Too hot and you can get flash curing) 
- If resin is "frothy" allow it to sit for awhile to ensure bubbles can float to the surface, you can use a lighter to pop these bubbles
- Spray a small amount of IPA on the mold before pouring
- Consider upgrading to a pressure pot

# Adjacent Face Seams

### What it Looks Like

A small gash or "seam" on the faces adjacent to the cap face (different from normal flashing)

### Causes

- Older Mold - Reaching the end of mold life
- Over pressurizing when casting

### Fixes

- Try to press the cap as flush as possible to the mold body  
- Continue sanding until the seam is gone
- Fix with UV resin

# Soft Cure

### What it Looks Like

Dice that are still squishy past the full/hard cure time for your resin

### Causes

- Improperly Mixed Resin
- Casting when it is too cold
- Too much material mixed in (Alcohol Ink, Mica, Etc) 
- Humidity Sensative Resins

### Fixes

- Try gently heating the dice or letting them sit in the sun
> Careful! This can change the color of your dice. Also, don't heat dice in the same places you cook food!
{.is-warning}
- Banish these dice to a sealed jar or use them for another purpose where they won't come in direct or close  contact with living creatures. (They still look pretty, but shouldn't be touched or used as toys.)
- When mixing resin, make sure to scrape the sides of the container and your stirring stick to ensure all the resin is mixed.

# Microscratches

### What it Looks Like

Tiny scratches still visible after fully polishing dice

### Causes

- Using too much pressure on lower grit papers
- Not using a polishing compound
- Not spending enough time on each grit
- Not protecting dice from scratching for the full cure time

### Fixes

- Spending more time on each polishing stage
- Gradually increase the grit (try not to skip papers unless you have an established process)

# Corner Issues and Chips

### What it Looks Like

Dice Corners that are uneven or don't line up. Chips in a master.

### Causes

- Heavy Handed sanding
- Overcorrecting other corners

### Fixes

- Sand the adjacent faces to correct
- Use a light hand when sanding, check the shape of your corners frequently to correct as you go
- Consider making a mold of your masters before sanding them. You can use resin casts from that mold to keep from needing reprints as you learn to sand.
- You can repair issues (like chips or problem edges) on masters by using superglue. Use super glue to build up the damaged area and then resume sanding once dry.

# Pressure Pot Issues

### What it Looks Like

Pressure Pot that won't hold pressure

### Causes

- Gasket misaligned
- Uneven tightening
- Fittings not properly sealed
- Broken Gauge or Regulator

### Fixes

- Test fill the pot before voiding the warranty/beginning the conversion process. 
- Tighten the clamps evenly, a little bit at a time on opposite sides of the pot 
- Ensure the gasket is evenly seated
- Apply a layer of Vaseline to the gasket (this can wear it out over time though!) 
- Use some soapy water along the connections, pressurize the pot and look for bubbles to identify leaks.
